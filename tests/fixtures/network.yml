        held for 23 years by the National Council for Scientific and Technological
        Development (CNPq) is maintained by ongoing Public Calls. The PELD network
        currently has 34 reference sites distributed in all biomes from Brazil, operating
        in dozens of protected areas and areas subject to anthropic impacts. The Program
        has a well-established and active management structure, in which the Management
        and Scientific Committees act in an integrated manner for strategic decisions
        in order to improve the Program. It is a member of the International Network
        for Long Term Ecological Research - ILTER, which brings together 44 member
        countries and their networks of long-term research sites. The program has
        been pooling efforts to foster a national culture devoted to long-term ecological
        research that can address environmental issues and point to solutions and
        practices for sustainable use of natural resources and ecosystem services,
        with important contributions to the proposition of public policies, promoting
        biodiversity conservation and human welfare.\n\nhttps://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br/acesso-a-informacao/acoes-e-programas/programas/peld","language":"eng","numConstituents":41,"email":[],"phone":[],"homepage":[],"address":[],"createdBy":"andrea","modifiedBy":"andrea","created":"2024-03-11T14:48:10.451+00:00","modified":"2024-03-11T14:54:56.037+00:00","contacts":[{"key":5179449,"type":"ADMINISTRATIVE_POINT_OF_CONTACT","primary":false,"userId":[],"firstName":"Conselho

        access, policies and practices, and aims to ensure that the data is easily
        Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR). As such, DiSSCo will
        transform a fragmented landscape of crucial natural science collections into
        an integrated knowledge base that provides interconnected hard evidence of
        the natural world. DiSSCo represents with 120+ collection holding institutions
        in 21 countries, the largest ever formal agreement between organisations of
        this type. These organisations join forces to develop and operate as a distributed
        Research Infrastructure. DiSSCo began its so-called Preparatory Phase in September
        2018 to develop a comprehensive Construction Masterplan, which will be followed
        by a construction phase. The RI will become fully operational in 2025. More
