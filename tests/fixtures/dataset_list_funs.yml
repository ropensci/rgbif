        the Phytoplankton samples collected within Wales from 2007 onwards by Natural
        Resources Wales and former Environment Agency Wales that are held within NRWs
        KiEco Database. This methodology is based on the principle that additional
        nutrients (especially nitrogen) can alter the amount of phytoplankton in transitional
        and coastal waters. Persistent and high counts of phytoplankton taxa are also
        seen as a measure of disturbance in the phytoplankton community. These surveys
        are conducted as part of on-going monitoring for legislative requirements
        and to meet organisational drivers. In addition, sites may be sampled for
        investigative work, or on an ad hoc basis.\r\n\r\nFor more detailed geospatial
