        Center is to discover the wildlife of Kansas. Numerous displays, dioramas,
        and exhibits provide close encounters with the native birds, fish, mammals,
        and reptiles of Kansas.\n\nOur \"winter\" diorama provides a glimpse of how
        wildlife deals with the snow and cold of Kansas winters.\n\nThe grassland
        display depicts the three grasslands (short, mixed and tall) of Kansas and
        wildlife common to each region; including a rare black-footed ferret. Our
        raptor exhibit features owls, hawks, falcons, and kites; all with hooked beaks
        and sharp talons. The wetland wall display includes Cheyenne Bottoms, one
        of the five most important wetlands in North America.\n\nThe Aquarium Room
        contains twelve, 400-600 gallon aquariums; each displaying fish species native
        to Kansas or that have been successfully introduced into Kansas. On the east
        wall are two wall panels. One featuring the early history of the Pratt Hatchery.
        The other features the catfish rearing program along with a working model

        its 10th anniversary in 2025 (Reiwa 7) as a \"comprehensive museum\" representing
        Hokkaido.\nAs a core museum in Hokkaido, the museum will collaborate with
        local museums and other institutions, and as a research museum with approximately
        30 curators and research staff, we will utilize the results of specialized
        and comprehensive research to strengthen our functions to meet diverse learning
        needs. In addition, as a comprehensive museum that can be proud of the world
        for specialized research on Ainu history and tangible and intangible culture,
        we will contribute to the promotion of Ainu culture and the realization of
        a multicultural society. Furthermore, we will contribute to the revitalization
        of the region while placing importance on our role as a cultural tourism base
