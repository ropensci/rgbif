        bugs are small invertebrates. It is classified as a legged animal. It is the
        boundary between crustaceans and insects. The stingrays belong to the class
        Collembola. Small in shape (0.2-8 mm), they are important in the ecosystem
        as a helper for the decomposition of organic matter. At present, there are
        more than 8,000 species of stinging insects that have been identified in the
        world for Thailand. There are reports of at least 4 stinging tail insects,
        14 families, 53 genera, 194 species. For an example of a flicker-tailed insect
        in the Museum of Natural History, the 50th Anniversary of the Royal Highness
        Six species of stinging insects were registered and model specimens, categorized
        into 4 groups of spiny-tailed stingrays:  Cyphoderopsis phangnga  Jantarit
        et al., 2013.  Cyphoderopsis thachana  Jantarit et al., 2013  Cyphoderopsis
        khaophang  Jantarit et . al., 2013, and  Cyphoderopsis cavicola  Jantarit
        et al., 2013, and two species of feather-tailed stingrays,  Cyphoderus songkhlaensis  Jantarit
        et al., 2014, and  Cyphoderus khaochakanus  Jantarit et al., 2014. due to
        knowledge of taxonomy The ecology of the tail bug in Thailand has not been
        widely studied and limited knowledge. Classification and Expert Guide This
        is why it is important that the number of registered stingray insects and
        the prototypes are limited. This resulted in a large number of biodiversity
        data of the stingrays in the cave. and many species tend to be new species.
        which is in the process of reviewing and disseminating academic results As
        a result, there are more than 9 families, 23 genera, and at least 61 species
        of bugs waiting to be registered in the museum''s database.","contentTypes":["PreservedOrganisms"],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"email":["psu.museum@gmail.com"],"phone":[],"homepage":"https://nhm.psu.ac.th/collection-th/insect-collection-th/","catalogUrls":[],"apiUrls":[],"preservationTypes":["StorageIndoors"],"institutionKey":"874ed64b-68f6-421a-a03b-5e64e67388a9","mailingAddress":{"key":44113,"address":"Museum

        from the terrestrial arthropods collections of the Muséum National d&#39;Histoire
        Naturelle (Paris).\n \n\t\t\t\tThe MNHN scorpion collection is one of the
        most important in the world, due to a long tradition of work on this group
        at the museum. The collection began to be formed towards the middle of the
        19th century and still contains types of some species described from this
        period by authors like Audouin, Savigny, Gervais and Guérin-Ménéville. The
        collection was considerably augmented during the period 1880‒1910 by E. Simon,
        who described numerous species either collected by himself or received through
        his extensive network of correspondents. During the 20th century scorpions
        were studied at the museum by Fage and by his successor, M. Vachon. Since
        the 1970s, systematic activity on the collection has continued intensively
        through the work of W. Lourenço, who was a student of Vachon. As a result,
        the collection is both large and rich, containing an unusually high proportion
        of type material. In addition to material studied by authors working at the
        museum, a significant part has come from outside sources, either through gift
        or exchange. Thus it also contains material studied by authorities such as
        R.I. Pocock, T. Thorell, K. Kraepelin, W.D. Sissom and V. Fet. The scorpion
        collection is worldwide in scope, but the best represented regions are tropical
        South America, North Africa, the Middle East, Western Africa, Madagascar and
        Southeast Asia. It contains over 9000 lots, including about 700 types, preserved
        in 80 % alcohol and stored in the museum’s Zoothèque. The collections are
        made available to external researchers, either through loans or visits, at
        the discretion of the curator. In cases where neither is feasible, photographic
        documentation of specimens may be provided on request.","contentTypes":[],"active":true,"personalCollection":false,"email":[],"phone":[],"catalogUrls":[],"apiUrls":[],"preservationTypes":[],"institutionKey":"6a6ac6c5-1b8a-48db-91a2-f8661274ff80","mailingAddress":{"key":43397},"address":{"key":43396,"address":"Muséum
