        dataset comprises thousands of photographs primarily documenting the flora
        and fauna of the San Marcos Pass region, located in the mountains behind Santa
        Barbara, California. The images have been collected over more than four decades
        by a dedicated local naturalist and educator with a focus on accurate species
        identification and meticulous record keeping. Most photographs were taken
        in close proximity to the contributor''s residence and serve as a long-term
        observational record of local plant biodiversity.</p><p>Originally hosted
        on Fotolog, the photo archive has since migrated to Flickr under the username
        treebeard, where mark has over 6.9M views. The photographs were captured using
        a Nikon D800 camera, primarily with Nikkor 105mm micro, 18–200mm, and Tamron
        200–500mm telephoto lenses. Basic post-processing was conducted using an older
        version of Paint Shop Pro (PSP), primarily to adjust curves, contrast, and
        cropping. The dataset supports ongoing efforts to develop a comprehensive
        flora database for the region.</p>","acknowledgements":"This dataset was created

        Zoology Collections at the Museum of Biological Diversity (OSUM)","description":"<p>The
        Division of Invertebrate Zoology at The Ohio State University Museum of Biological
        Diversity is a major center for research on the evolution, ecology, taxonomy
        and conservation of global invertebrate biodiversity. We maintain several
        important natural history collections of invertebrates: Bivalve Mollusks,
        Gastropods (and other non-bivalve mollusks), Crustaceans, and General Invertebrates.\nThough
        we have specimens collected as early as the 1810s, the collections formally
        began in the 1890s as part of the \"O.S.U. Museum of Zoology\". The collections
        were then managed by the Ohio Historical Society (OHS) which operated on OSU''s
        campus as \"The Ohio State Museum\" from about 1925 to the 1960s. In 1970,
        the University became the primary custodian of all the zoological collections
        aside from a small synoptic set of Ohio material retained by OHS. The invertebrate
        collections were historically curated independently as 3 separate Divisions
        of the museum, but have been been managed as one Invertebrate Zoology Division
        of the Museum of Biological Diversity since 2024. \nThe invertebrate zoology
        collections contain &gt;1.5 million dry and &gt;900,000 fluid-preserved specimens
        in ca. 125,000 cataloged lots. Our collecting and curatorial efforts are predominantly
        focused on documenting the worldwide distribution and diversity of non-marine
        (i.e. land and freshwater) invertebrates, specifically mollusks and crustaceans.
        We maintain the largest collection of freshwater bivalves in the world, and
        our gastropod and crayfish collections are also among the worlds'' largest.</p>","language":"eng","homepage":"https://invertebrates.osu.edu/","citation":{"text":"Shoobs

        Ornithology collection","description":"The ornithological collection of the
        Museum of Nature Hamburg (formerly Zoological Museum Hamburg or ZMH) includes
        approximately 70,000 specimens, and encompasses roughly one quarter of all
        recognized species of birds. This collection includes the following highlights:  •   Extinct
        & endangered species, type material  •   An egg collection, including intact
        clutches parasitized by cuckoos  •   A collection of roughly 4,000 skeletal
        specimens, and 2,000 fluid specimens  •   Approximately 30,000 wing or feather
        preparations  •   High temporal and spatial sampling of Northern Germany  •   Approximately
        2,000 specimens of the Eurasian Magpie  •   Specimens from South Pacific acquired
        by the Museum Godeffroy  •   Significant 20th century collections from:       o   Helgoland
        & Schleswig-Holstein       o   West Papua       o   India       o   South
        Georgia & the Falklands       o   Peru & Ecuador       o   Angola       o   South
        Africa       o   The Philippines  •   Additional material in the form of nests,
        histology slides, photos, and audio recordings    In the 19th century, the
        ZMH was a star attraction in the center of Hamburg, and its taxonomic significance
        grew with the acquisition of specimens from the Museum Goddefroy. The destruction
        of the museum and its catalog during the Second World War was a tremendous
        setback involving a dramatic loss of specimens. In the post-war period, efforts
        were made to rebuild the collection through acquisition of private collections,
        expeditions, and exchange. However, this development dropped off between the
        1980s and the present decade. This partially matches global trends in the
        decrease in bird collection during this time, but was exacerbated in Hamburg
        by the loss of institutional investment, curation staff, and finally parts
        of the collection space.    Today the collection is used by the museum and
        its staff to study and communicate the diversity of bird life, its evolutionary
        origins, and its current state in relation to human impacts. Researchers in
        Hamburg and visitors from elsewhere use the collection to study molecular
        phylogenetics and avian systematics, as well as the evolution of morphology
        and behavior. Future generations of researchers should be able to use the
        collection as a resource for both comparative and longitudinal studies of
        avian diversity, ecology and evolution. However, Hamburg’s vibrant art scene
        also finds a use for the bird collection as either inspiration, or as the
        subject of painting and photography. Furthermore, the taxidermy mount collection
        features prominently in both temporary and permanent exhibits at the Museum
        of Nature Hamburg, as well as outreach events with local schools.","language":"eng","homepage":"https://leibniz-lib.de/en/collections/zoological-collections/ornithology-hamburg.html","logoUrl":"https://leibniz-lib.de/wp-content/themes/lib-leibniz/img/logo-en.svg","citation":{"text":"Leibniz

        are subsequently uploaded to one of many compatible data nodes, adding to
        the reach of an intercompatible network of networks designed and maintained
        by the Ocean Tracking Network, producing current and reliable records for

        presents newly collected records of amphipod specimens gathered during the
        2024 scientific benthic survey (Cruise DOG24) at the Dogger Bank, North Sea,
        part of an ongoing annual monitoring effort that has taken place from 1991
        to 2024. A total of 8,444 specimens of 14 species belonging to 13 families,
        14 genera, and 10 species were identified using morphological methods with
        Leica M60 and DM750 microscopes. Amphipods, key components of marine benthic
        ecosystems, were sampled by beam trawl over the Dogger Bank’s stable sandy
        substrate. This dataset supports a broader research project aimed at (i) developing
        a taxonomic key for Dogger Bank amphipods, (ii) identifying environmental
        drivers of species distribution and diversity, and (iii) predicting responses
        to climate change. Data were structured following the Darwin Core standard.</p><p>The
        Dogger Bank epibenthos is sampled with a 2 m beam trawl at 37 stations on
        a yearly basis since 1991 by Senckenberg Marine Zoology. At each station,
        the catch is sieved to preserve the fine fraction (1 cm - 1 mm), while megafaunal
        animals are sorted, identified and recorded by their abundance on board of
        RV Senckenberg. The crustacean and Ichthyology collections at Senckenberg
        Marine Zoology house the fine fractions from these cruises. In this project,
        we aim to identify the amphipod species composition and relative abundance
        from these fine fractions. Starting with the analysis of the fine fractions
        from the year 2024, we will step by step enhance the dataset with identifications
        of amphipod fine fractions from other years, back until 1991.</p>","language":"eng","citation":{"text":"Habibi

        be achieved in the framework of workshops during which the consortium members
        and their collaborators, students, and supervisors of theses of the master
        program will be invited. The end-users from DGEFC, CENAGREF, and Hôpital Menontin
        will present their needs of information and the decisions they wish to support.\nThe
        needs of information will be reformulated into key questions to be answered
        with respect to the decisions to be supported so as to identify the possible
        information resources to be taken into account. They can be databases like
        GBIF, Vertnet, species links etc. Any other relevant sources of information
        (data holders, data users, resource persons etc.) will also be considered.
        This will result in a plan of data mobilization, data publication, and data
        uses to support decisions. This plan will be consolidated through partnership
        agreements between parties.\nDuring data mobilization phase, taking into account
        the key questions to be answered, research topics will be identified and attributed
        to the students of the master program and other data users. Data will then
        be downloaded from GBIF, Vertenet, species links etc. and data gap analysis
        will be performed so as to find out the gaps of occurrences to be filled either
        from complementary field surveys, data holders, and literature reviews etc.
        Data collected to fill data gaps will be formatted, georeferenced, cleaned
        up, and published on GBIF site.\nThe evaluation process will be carried out
        in two phases: i) during the information development phase, under the umbrella
        of their supervisors and the advisor of the program, students will process
        data to provide relevant answers to the key questions in order to guide the
        intended decision making of the partners; ii) in an evaluation phase, the
        results obtained (answers to the key questions) will be scrutinized with respect
        to their adequacy to support the intended decisions of end-users and, whenever
        necessary, data mobilization and data analysis refinements will be reconsidered
        to provide more relevant answers to the key questions to support decisions.","relatedProjects":[],"abstract":"This

        the appropriated needs of information and related key research questions to
        be answered. Data needs will then be adequately identified and, data mobilization
        in free access databases like GBIF, data gap analysis on available data, and
        complementary data mobilization in data holdings will be planned. Data mobilization,
        data and checklist publications on GBIF site will then be achieved.\nUnder

        and refinement of data mobilization and data solutions to fit more conveniently
        in decisions making during and beyond the project.\nData solutions will be
