        a comprehensive study of vascular plant diversity was carried out in an oak

        Forestry of the State Enterprise “Klavdiivka Forest Research Station”. The
        oak stand (compartment 20, plot 9, area 14.6 ha) (Didukh, 2025). Forest ecosystems
        have partially experienced significant anthropogenic impact as a result of
        fortification construction by Russian troops in 2022, which caused damage
        to the soil and vegetation cover, changes in microclimatic conditions, and
        alterations in the ecosystem structure (Moysiyenko et al., 2025).\nThe aim
        of the study was to assess the state of vegetation and document changes in
        the structure and species composition of the oak forest affected by the construction
        of fortifications. This dataset contains occurrences of ___ vascular plants

        Tesař, belonging to the scarab beetle subfamily Aphodiinae, currently includes
        20 valid species distributed across the Eastern Palearctic and Oriental Regions.
        The genus is characterised by the following elytral features: broad and deep
        striae; striae prominently punctate and distinctly crenulate; intervals tectiform
        with a median carina; and the sixth and eighth intervals joined at the pre-apical
        area, though lacking a carina in that region. Two species are recognised in
        the Korean Peninsula, Carinaulus inexpectatus (Balthasar, 1935) in North Korea
        and Carinaulus coreensis (Kim, 1986) in South Korea. Carinaulus inexpectatus
        (Balthasar, 1935), with Vladivostok designated as its type locality, occurs
        in the Russian Far East and North Korea, whereas C. coreensis (Kim, 1986)
        is considered endemic to South Korea.During examination of Korean Carinaulus
        Tesař, we compared several specimens of Carinaulus coreensis (Kim, 1986),
        including a paratype and C. inexpectatus (Balthasar, 1935) collected from
        North Korea. We found that the two nominal species cannot be distinguised
        by the morphological characters, including labrum chaetotaxy and male genitalia.
        Accordingly, it is proposed that Aphodius coreensis Kim, 1986, is a subjective
        junior synonym of Aphodius nexpectatus Balthasar, 1935.</p>","language":"eng","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.13.e169855","citation":{"text":"Song

        barcoding analysis","description":"<p>The genus Roeslerstammia Zeller, 1839,
        the type genus of the family Roeslerstammiidae, comprises a total of four
        species on a global scale. The type species, Roeslerstammia erxlebella (Fabricius,
        1787) is distributed across the Palaearctic Region, from Europe to Japan.
        However, the presence of this species has only been confirmed in European
        countries, Russia and Japan.The present study reports the first record of
        Roeslerstammia erxlebella in Korea, specifically from Odae-san National Park.
        This paper constitutes a review of the taxonomic history of the family Roeslerstammiidae
        and the genus Roeslerstammia. A thorough taxonomic account of the recently
        documented species, R. erxlebella, is presented, accompanied by a taxonomic
        key and an illustrated map delineating the geographical distribution of the
        genus Roeslerstammia. Furthemore, the DNA Barcode data of a Korean individual
        was made available, alongside public data from BOLD systems. The DNA Barcoding
        analysis further indicates that the Korean individual is R. erxlebella.</p>","language":"eng","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.13.e171683","citation":{"text":"Park

        Tesař, belonging to the scarab beetle subfamily Aphodiinae, currently includes
        20 valid species distributed across the Eastern Palearctic and Oriental Regions.
        The genus is characterised by the following elytral features: broad and deep
        striae; striae prominently punctate and distinctly crenulate; intervals tectiform
        with a median carina; and the sixth and eighth intervals joined at the pre-apical
        area, though lacking a carina in that region. Two species are recognised in
        the Korean Peninsula, Carinaulus inexpectatus (Balthasar, 1935) in North Korea
        and Carinaulus coreensis (Kim, 1986) in South Korea. Carinaulus inexpectatus
        (Balthasar, 1935), with Vladivostok designated as its type locality, occurs
        in the Russian Far East and North Korea, whereas C. coreensis (Kim, 1986)
        is considered endemic to South Korea.During examination of Korean Carinaulus
        Tesař, we compared several specimens of Carinaulus coreensis (Kim, 1986),
        including a paratype and C. inexpectatus (Balthasar, 1935) collected from
        North Korea. We found that the two nominal species cannot be distinguised
        by the morphological characters, including labrum chaetotaxy and male genitalia.
        Accordingly, it is proposed that Aphodius coreensis Kim, 1986, is a subjective
        junior synonym of Aphodius nexpectatus Balthasar, 1935.</p>","language":"eng","homepage":"https://doi.org/10.3897/BDJ.13.e169855","citation":{"text":"Song

        Roeslerstammia erxlebella in Korea, specifically from Odae-san National Park.
        This paper constitutes a review of the taxonomic history of the family Roeslerstammiidae

        a comprehensive study of vascular plant diversity was carried out in an oak
        forest near the village of Myrotske, Kyiv Region, belonging to the Klavdiivka
        Forestry of the State Enterprise “Klavdiivka Forest Research Station”. The
        oak stand (compartment 20, plot 9, area 14.6 ha) (Didukh, 2025). Forest ecosystems
        have partially experienced significant anthropogenic impact as a result of
        fortification construction by Russian troops in 2022, which caused damage
        to the soil and vegetation cover, changes in microclimatic conditions, and
        alterations in the ecosystem structure (Moysiyenko et al., 2025).\nThe aim
        of the study was to assess the state of vegetation and document changes in
        the structure and species composition of the oak forest affected by the construction
        of fortifications. This dataset contains occurrences of ___ vascular plants
        species  recorded in 30 relevés. The nomenclature of the dataset is as follows:

        Our findings provide essential baseline data to inform wildlife conservation
        and reserve management in this subtropical region.A survey employing 32 infrared
        cameras over 11,680 camera-days yielded 7,625 independent detections of 15
        species belonging to 5 orders, 13 genera, and 10 families. The top five species
        with the highest relative abundance index (RAI) values were Reeves’s muntjac
        (Muntiacus reevesi), wild boar (Sus scrofa), Tibetan macaque (Macaca thibetana
        huangshanensis), masked palm civet (Paguma larvata), and Malayan porcupine
        (Hystrix brachyura). We describe the diel activity rhythms and seasonal altitudinal
        migration patterns of seven focal threatened species. The daily activity patterns
        of Reeves’s muntjacs, black muntjacs (Muntiacus crinifrons), and Tibetan macaques
        were bimodal, with dominant diurnal habits, whereas masked palm civets, Malayan
        porcupines, hog badgers (Arctonyx collaris), and serows (Capricornis sumatraensis)
        were nocturnal species. Activity peaks also shifted seasonally. We further
        observed seasonal altitudinal migration patterns: diurnal mammals such as
        Reeves''s muntjacs, black muntjacs, and Tibetan macaques frequented mid-altitude
        in summer, while nocturnal species such as hog badgers, Malayan porcupines,
        and masked palm civets were more common at mid-altitude in winter. This pattern
        could be attributed to thermoregulation and other ecological factors. This

        verdadera mediante el numero efectivo de especies qD (q=0, q=1 y q=2), con
        el programa en línea SpadeR (Jost. 2006; Moreno et al. 2011; Chao et al. 2015).
        Se elaboró un listado de especies para cada reserva, especificando cada cobertura
        identificada, así como diagramas con diversidad taxonómica (Familias y géneros
        más diversos y abundantes).\nLa estructura horizontal se evaluó mediante el
        índice de valor de importancia IVI, para cada cobertura censada en las reservas
        y se crearán categorías diamétricas. La estructura vertical se evaluó creando
        categorías altimétricas y perfiles de la vegetación. El número y tamaño de
        las categorías diamétricas y altimétricas se elaboraron mediante las ecuaciones
        planteadas por Rangel & Velázquez (1997).\nSe estimó la biomasa y el carbono
        almacenado de cada cobertura vegetal en las reservas mediante la metodología
        de ecuaciones y usando las medidas dasométricas tomadas en el estudio florístico."]},"countryCoverage":[],"collections":[],"dataDescriptions":[],"dataLanguage":"spa","acknowledgements":"Agradecemos

        to buoys, gliders and large animals (e.g. grey seals) pick up the coded acoustic
        signals from these tags identifying each tagged sea creature that passes within
        half a kilometer of the receiver. Data collected by these listening stations
        are subsequently uploaded to one of many compatible data nodes, adding to
        the reach of an intercompatible network of networks designed and maintained
        by the Ocean Tracking Network, producing current and reliable records for
        every part of the globe. Certain classes of electronic tags and listening

        Dogger Bank Monitoring Data_Amphipoda_2024","description":"<p>This dataset
        presents newly collected records of amphipod specimens gathered during the
        2024 scientific benthic survey (Cruise DOG24) at the Dogger Bank, North Sea,
        part of an ongoing annual monitoring effort that has taken place from 1991
        to 2024. A total of 8,444 specimens of 14 species belonging to 13 families,
        14 genera, and 10 species were identified using morphological methods with
        Leica M60 and DM750 microscopes. Amphipods, key components of marine benthic
        ecosystems, were sampled by beam trawl over the Dogger Bank’s stable sandy
        substrate. This dataset supports a broader research project aimed at (i) developing
        a taxonomic key for Dogger Bank amphipods, (ii) identifying environmental
        drivers of species distribution and diversity, and (iii) predicting responses
        to climate change. Data were structured following the Darwin Core standard.</p><p>The
        Dogger Bank epibenthos is sampled with a 2 m beam trawl at 37 stations on
        a yearly basis since 1991 by Senckenberg Marine Zoology. At each station,
        the catch is sieved to preserve the fine fraction (1 cm - 1 mm), while megafaunal
        animals are sorted, identified and recorded by their abundance on board of
        RV Senckenberg. The crustacean and Ichthyology collections at Senckenberg
        Marine Zoology house the fine fractions from these cruises. In this project,
        we aim to identify the amphipod species composition and relative abundance
        from these fine fractions. Starting with the analysis of the fine fractions
        from the year 2024, we will step by step enhance the dataset with identifications
        of amphipod fine fractions from other years, back until 1991.</p>","language":"eng","citation":{"text":"Habibi

        program will be invited. The end-users from DGEFC, CENAGREF, and Hôpital Menontin
        will present their needs of information and the decisions they wish to support.\nThe
        needs of information will be reformulated into key questions to be answered
        with respect to the decisions to be supported so as to identify the possible
        information resources to be taken into account. They can be databases like
        GBIF, Vertnet, species links etc. Any other relevant sources of information
        (data holders, data users, resource persons etc.) will also be considered.
        This will result in a plan of data mobilization, data publication, and data
        uses to support decisions. This plan will be consolidated through partnership
        agreements between parties.\nDuring data mobilization phase, taking into account
        the key questions to be answered, research topics will be identified and attributed
        to the students of the master program and other data users. Data will then
        be downloaded from GBIF, Vertenet, species links etc. and data gap analysis
        will be performed so as to find out the gaps of occurrences to be filled either
        from complementary field surveys, data holders, and literature reviews etc.
        Data collected to fill data gaps will be formatted, georeferenced, cleaned
        up, and published on GBIF site.\nThe evaluation process will be carried out
        in two phases: i) during the information development phase, under the umbrella
        of their supervisors and the advisor of the program, students will process
        data to provide relevant answers to the key questions in order to guide the
        intended decision making of the partners; ii) in an evaluation phase, the
        results obtained (answers to the key questions) will be scrutinized with respect
        to their adequacy to support the intended decisions of end-users and, whenever
        necessary, data mobilization and data analysis refinements will be reconsidered

        through their master research topics will achieve, in response to the key
        research questions, adequate data analysis and address the required needs
        of information to support decisions making of government institutions.\nFollowing
        the evaluation process by end-users, a plan will be set in place through partnership
        agreements between parties so as to enable the establishment of workflows
        and refinement of data mobilization and data solutions to fit more conveniently
        in decisions making during and beyond the project.\nData solutions will be
        used in national biodiversity policy and international biodiversity platforms.

        on biodiversity assessments will be provided to end-users."},"samplingDescription":{"studyExtent":"South-East
