#'
#' @section Multiple values passed to a parameter:
#' There are some parameters you can pass multiple values to in a vector,
#' each value of which produces a different request (multiple different
#' requests = c("a","b")). Some parameters allow multiple values to be passed 
#' in the same request (multiple same request = "a;b") in a semicolon separated 
#' string (e.g., 'a;b'); if given we'll do a single request with that parameter
#' repeated for each value given (e.g., `foo=a&foo=b` if the parameter
#' is `foo`).  
#' 
#' See article [Multiple Values](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/multiple_values.html).
#' 
#' @section Hierarchies:
#' Hierarchies are returned with each occurrence object. There is no
#' option to return them from the API. However, within the \code{occ_search}
#' function you can select whether to return just hierarchies, just data, all
#' of data and hierarchies and metadata, or just metadata. If all hierarchies
#' are the same we just return one for you.
#'
#' @section curl debugging:
#' You can pass parameters not defined in this function into the call to
#' the GBIF API to control things about the call itself using \code{curlopts}.
#' See an example below that passes in the \code{verbose} function to get
#' details on the http call.
#'
#' @section WKT:
#' Examples of valid WKT objects:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item 'POLYGON((-19.5 34.1, 27.8 34.1, 35.9 68.1, -25.3 68.1, -19.5 34.1))'
#'  \item 'MULTIPOLYGON(((-123 38,-116 38,-116 43,-123 43,-123 38)),((-97 41,-93 41,-93 45,-97 45,-97 41)))'
#'  \item 'POINT(-120 40)'
#'  \item 'LINESTRING(3 4,10 50,20 25)'
#' }
#'
#' Note that GBIF expects counter-clockwise winding order for WKT. You can
#' supply clockwise WKT, but GBIF treats it as an exclusion, so you get all
#' data not inside the WKT area. [occ_download()] behaves differently
#' in that you should simply get no data back at all with clockwise WKT.
#'
#' @section Long WKT:
#' Options for handling long WKT strings:
#' Note that long WKT strings are specially handled when using \code{\link{occ_search}} or
#' \code{\link{occ_data}}. Here are the three options for long WKT strings (> 1500 characters),
#' set one of these three via the parameter \code{geom_big}:
#' \itemize{
#'  \item asis - the default setting. This means we don't do anything internally. That is,
#'  we just pass on your WKT string just as we've done before in this package.
#'  \item axe - this option is deprecated since rgbif v3.8.0. Might return error, 
#'  since the GBIF's polygon interpretation has changed. 
#'
#'  This method uses \code{sf::st_make_grid} and \code{sf::st_intersection}, which has 
#'  two parameters \code{cellsize} and \code{n}. You can tweak those parameters here by
#'  tweaking \code{geom_size} and \code{geom_n}. \code{geom_size} seems to be more useful in
#'  toggling the number of WKT strings you get back.
#'
#'  See \code{\link{wkt_parse}} to manually break make WKT bounding box from a larger WKT
#'  string, or break a larger WKT string into many smaller ones.
#'
#'  \item bbox - this option checks whether your WKT string is longer than 1500 characters,
#'  and if it is we create a bounding box from the WKT, do the GBIF search with that
#'  bounding box, then prune the resulting data to only those occurrences in your original
#'  WKT string. There is a big caveat however. Because we create a bounding box from the WKT,
#'  and the \code{limit} parameter determines some subset of records to get, then when we
#'  prune the resulting data to the WKT, the number of records you get could be less than
#'  what you set with your \code{limit} parameter. However, you could set the limit to be
#'  high enough so that you get all records back found in that bounding box, then you'll
#'  get all the records available within the WKT.
#' }
#'
#'
#' @section Counts:
#' There is a slight difference in the way records are counted here vs.
#' results from \code{\link{occ_count}}. For equivalent outcomes, in this
#' function use \code{hasCoordinate=TRUE}, and \code{hasGeospatialIssue=FALSE}
#' to have the same outcome using \code{\link{occ_count}} with
#' \code{isGeoreferenced=TRUE}
