There are two ways to get occurrence data from GBIF:

1.  [occ_download()](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_download.html): unlimited records. Useful for research and citation.
2.  [occ_search()](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_search.html): limited to 100K records. Useful primarily for testing.

The function `occ_search()` (and related function `occ_data()`) **should not** be used for serious research. Users sometimes find it easier to use `occ_search()` rather than `occ_download()` because they do not need to supply a username or password, and also do not need to wait for a download to finish. However, any serious research project should always use `occ_download()` instead.

## occ_download()

`occ_download()` is the **best way** to get GBIF mediated occurrences.

The main functions related to downloads are:

-   [occ_download()](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_download.html): start a download on GBIF servers.
-   [occ_download_prep()](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_download_prep.html): preview a download request before sending to GBIF.
-   [occ_download_get()](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_download_get.html): retrieve a download from GBIF to your computer.
-   [occ_download_import()](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/occ_download_import.html): load a download from your computer to R.

<!-- You might also find these other functions useful in certain scenarios:  -->

<!-- - `occ_download_queue()`: start many downloads in a queue (only 3 at a time possible) -->

<!-- - `occ_download_meta()`: get metadata on a single download. -->

<!-- - `occ_download_list()`: list your previous downloads. -->

<!-- - `occ_download_cancel()`: cancel a download. -->

<!-- - `occ_download_cancel_staged()`: cancels any active jobs. -->

To make a download request, `occ_download()` uses [helper functions](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/reference/download_predicate_dsl.html) starting with **pred**. These functions **define filters** on the large GBIF occurrence table, so that only a usable subset is returned. The predicate functions are named for the 'type' of operation they do, following the terminology [used by GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence#predicates).

| function         | description                           | example                                                         |
|:------------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------|
| `pred()`         | key is equal to value                 | `pred("taxonKey",212)`                                          |
| `pred_lt()`      | key is less than value.               | `pred_lt("coordinateUncertaintyInMeters",5000)`                 |
| `pred_lte()`     | key is less than or equal to value    | `pred_lte("year", 1900)`                                        |
| `pred_gt()`      | key is greater than value             | `pred_gt("elevation", 1000)`                                    |
| `pred_gte()`     | key is greater than or equal to value | `pred_gte("depth", 1000)`                                       |
| `pred_not()`     | key is not value                      | `pred_not("taxonKey",212)`                                      |
| `pred_like()`    | key like pattern                      | `pred_like("catalogNumber","PAPS5-560*")`                       |
| `pred_within()`  | lat-lon values within WKT polygon     | `pred_within('POLYGON((-14 42, 9 38, -7 26, -14 42))')`         |
| `pred_notnull()` | column is not NULL                    | `pred_notnull("establishmentMeans")`                            |
| `pred_isnull()`  | column is NULL                        | `pred_isnull("recordedBy")`                                     |
| `pred_and()`     | a logical and of predicate functions  | `pred_and(pred_lte("elevation",5000),pred("taxonKey",212))`     |
| `pred_or()`      | a logical or of predicate functions   | `pred_or(pred_gt("elevation", 1000), pred_isnull("elevation"))` |
| `pred_in()`      | values are in the column              | `pred_in("taxonKey",c(2977832,2977901,2977966))`                |

## A Very Simple Download

It is required to set up your **GBIF credentials** to make downloads from GBIF. I suggest that you follow this [short tutorial](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/gbif_credentials.html) before continuing.

The following will download all occurrences of *Lepus saxatilis*. You can use `name_backbone("Lepus saxatilis")` to find the taxonKey (usageKey).

``` r
# remember to set up your GBIF credentials
occ_download(pred("taxonKey", 2436775),format = "SIMPLE_CSV")
```

    <<gbif download>>
      Your download is being processed by GBIF:
      https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/download/0079311-210914110416597
      Most downloads finish within 15 min.
      Check status with
      occ_download_wait('0079311-210914110416597')
      After it finishes, use
      d <- occ_download_get('0079311-210914110416597') %>%
        occ_download_import()
      to retrieve your download.

      Created: 2021-12-14T13:02:09.610+00:00
    Citation Info:  
      Please always cite the download DOI when using this data.

      Citation:
      GBIF Occurrence Download https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.dqp6a3 Accessed from R via rgbif (https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif) on 2021-12-14

The print out tells us that we can wait for the download to finish with `occ_download_wait()`. Most downloads under 100K records run very quickly. You can also check the status of a download on your [GBIF user page](https://www.gbif.org/user/download).

``` r
occ_download_wait('0079311-210914110416597') # checks if download is finished
```

The print out tells you can get this download using `occ_download_get()` and `occ_download_import()`.

``` r
d <- occ_download_get('0079311-210914110416597') %>%
  occ_download_import()
```

It is also possible save your download into an object and pass that into `occ_download_get()`.

``` r
gbif_download <- occ_download(pred("taxonKey", 2436775),format = "SIMPLE_CSV")

occ_download_wait(gbif_download)

d <- occ_download_get(gbif_download) %>%
  occ_download_import()
```

Note that the **citation** appears in the print out. This is what you would use if used this download in a research paper. Please also see GBIF's [citation guidelines](https://www.gbif.org/citation-guidelines) when using GBIF mediated data.

    GBIF Occurrence Download https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.dqp6a3 Accessed from R via rgbif (https://github.com/ropensci/rgbif) on 2021-12-14

You could also get this citation by running `gbif_citation()` or checking your [user page](https://www.gbif.org/user/download).

``` r
gbif_citation('0078589-210914110416597')
# or
# gbif_citation(gbif_download)
```

## A More Realistic Download

Typically GBIF downloads follow a particular pattern, and the same filters are used again and again. These are some common filters that you should probably be using.

``` r
occ_download(
pred("hasGeospatialIssue", FALSE),
pred("hasCoordinate", TRUE),
pred("occurrenceStatus","PRESENT"), 
pred_not(pred_in("basisOfRecord",c("FOSSIL_SPECIMEN","LIVING_SPECIMEN"))),
pred("taxonKey", 2436775),
format = "SIMPLE_CSV"
)
```

This download will ...

-   Remove default geospatial issues.
-   Keep only records with coordinates.
-   Remove absent records.
-   Remove fossils and living specimens
-   Retrieve all *Lepus saxatilis*.


The code above is commonly used, but pretty long. This is why `pred_default()` was created. 

``` r
# shorter equivalent to download above
occ_download(
pred_default(), 
pred("taxonKey", 2436775), 
format = "SIMPLE_CSV"
)
```

## Long species list downloads 

Another common download pattern is **long species list downloads**. There is a tutorial about downloading from a long list of species [here](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/downloading_a_long_species_list.html).

## A Complex Download For Illustration

Here I make an overly complex download to highlight some of the capabilities of `occ_download()`. Most useful downloads are much simpler.

``` r
occ_download(
type="and",
    pred("taxonKey", 2436775),
    pred("hasGeospatialIssue", FALSE),
    pred("hasCoordinate", TRUE),
    pred("occurrenceStatus","PRESENT"), 
    pred_gte("year", 1900),
    pred_not(pred_in("basisOfRecord",c("FOSSIL_SPECIMEN","LIVING_SPECIMEN"))),
  pred_or(
    pred("country","ZA"),
    pred("gadm","ETH")
    ),
  pred_or(
    pred_not(pred_in("establishmentMeans",c("MANAGED","INTRODUCED"))),
    pred_isnull("establishmentMeans")
    ),
  pred_or(  
    pred_lt("coordinateUncertaintyInMeters",10000),
    pred_isnull("coordinateUncertaintyInMeters")
    ),
format = "SIMPLE_CSV"
)
```

This download will ...

-   `pred("taxonKey", 2436775)` : all *Lepus saxatilis* records
-   `pred("hasGeospatialIssue", FALSE)` : remove default geospatial issues.
-   `pred("hasCoordinate", TRUE)` : keep only records with coordinates.
-   `pred("occurrenceStatus","PRESENT")` : remove absent records.
-   `pred_not(pred_in("basisOfRecord",c("FOSSIL_SPECIMEN","LIVING_SPECIMEN")))`: Remove fossils and living specimens
-   `pred_gte("year", 1900)` : after/or year 1900
-   `pred_or(pred("country","ZA"),pred("gadm","ETH"))` in South Africa or Ethiopia, using separate polygon systems. See `enumeration_country()` for country codes. 
-   `pred_or(pred_not(pred_in("establishmentMeans",c("MANAGED","INTRODUCED"))),pred_isnull("establishmentMeans"))` : establishmentMeans column does not contain managed or introduced species, but can be left blank.
-   `pred_or(pred_lt("coordinateUncertaintyInMeters",10000),pred_isnull("coordinateUncertaintyInMeters"))` : coordinateUncertaintyInMeters is less 10K meter or is left blank.
-   `format = "SIMPLE_CSV"` : return just a tsv file of occurrences.

## Not Downloads

Another sometimes useful pattern is **downloading all occurrences except some group**. Birds make up a [large portion](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/taxonomy) of GBIF occurrences. If you wanted to download everything but birds, you could use `pred_not()`.

``` r
# name_backbone("Aves")
occ_download(pred_not("taxonKey", 212),format = "SIMPLE_CSV")
```

## Big Polygon Downloads

Sometimes users will want to download records using a large polygon. It is worth noting that many land-based polygons can be captured using the [gadm filter](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?gadm_gid=BWA&gadm_gid=VAT&gadm_gid=BHS.17_1&gadm_gid=TWN&gadm_gid=NZL.2_1). Here I will download all occurrences within this biodiversity hotspot known as [Wallacea](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?has_geospatial_issue=false&geometry=POLYGON%20((127.0171%204.9391,%20124.5973%204.7960,%20121.7968%203.7617,%20119.0816%203.0776,%20119.1999%200.5229,%20117.3936%20-5.1010,%20116.4971%20-6.7425,%20115.9096%20-8.2031,%20115.5687%20-9.9150,%20117.2358%20-10.0975,%20120.9361%20-11.4096,%20122.5775%20-11.8123,%20123.5516%20-11.8544,%20125.5775%20-11.2832,%20128.6224%20-9.7196,%20131.1873%20-9.1914,%20132.1547%20-8.3925,%20133.4920%20-6.4151,%20133.6129%20-5.8375,%20133.5079%20-5.1369,%20133.1861%20-4.7011,%20131.4894%20-3.3231,%20129.8271%20-2.4649,%20129.3679%20-2.0044,%20129.1699%20-1.1486,%20129.7026%20-0.2859,%20129.7691%200.2902,%20129.4364%202.4420,%20128.9881%203.3626,%20128.3585%204.1683,%20127.7041%204.6918,%20127.0171%204.9391))).

A polygon may contain a **maximum of 10,000 points**, but in practice this number might be less depending the complexity of the polygon. You also have to make sure your polygons are in "anticlockwise" ordering of points. See downloads [documentation](https://www.gbif.org/developer/occurrence#download).

``` r

# Simple code to go from shapefile to WKT
# large_wkt <- sf::st_read("large_shapefile") %>% 
# sf::st_geometry() %>% 
# sf::st_as_text()

large_wkt <- "POLYGON ((127.0171 4.9391, 124.5973 4.7960, 121.7968 3.7617,
119.0816 3.0776, 119.1999 0.5229, 117.3936 -5.1010, 116.4971 -6.7425,
115.9096 -8.2031, 115.5687 -9.9150, 117.2358 -10.0975, 120.9361 -11.4096,
122.5775 -11.8123, 123.5516 -11.8544, 125.5775 -11.2832, 128.6224 -9.7196,
131.1873 -9.1914, 132.1547 -8.3925, 133.4920 -6.4151, 133.6129 -5.8375,
133.5079 -5.1369, 133.1861 -4.7011, 131.4894 -3.3231, 129.8271 -2.4649, 
129.3679 -2.0044, 129.1699 -1.1486, 129.7026 -0.2859, 129.7691 0.2902, 
129.4364 2.4420, 128.9881 3.3626, 128.3585 4.1683, 127.7041 4.6918,
127.0171 4.9391))" 

occ_download(pred_within(large_wkt),format = "SIMPLE_CSV"))
```

Due to changes in GBIF's polygon interpretation, you might get an error when using polygons wound in the "wrong direction" (clockwise). For example, the R package `sf` returns WKT polygons clockwise by default. One solution is to use the `wk` package to reorient the polygon prior to feeding it to `pred_within()`. 

```r
wkt %>%
  wk::wkt() %>% 
  wk::wk_orient()
```

## Downloading verbatim DWCA extensions

Additional Darwin Core extension data can also be included in a DWCA download. These data tables are not processed by GBIF. They are as-published.

The extension tables available for download are provided using `occ_download_describe("dwca")$verbatimExtensions`. They can be requested by adding a `verbatim_extensions()` expression to the `occ_download()` request. The format has to be "DWCA" for `verbatim_extensions()` to work. 


```r
occ_download(
    pred("country", "USA"),
    verbatim_extensions(
    "http://rs.tdwg.org/chrono/terms/ChronometricAge",
    "http://rs.gbif.org/terms/1.0/DNADerivedData"
    ),
    format = "DWCA"
    )
```

## Filter Country Centroids

> Sometimes GBIF data publishers will not know the exact lat-lon location of a record and will enter the lat-long center of the country instead. This is a data issue because users might be unaware that an observation is pinned to a country center and assume it is a precise location.

It is possible to filter out **country/area centroids** in a download using the `distanceFromCentroidInMeters` filter.

``` r
# download occurrences that are at least 2km from a centroid in Sweden
occ_download(
pred_gte("distanceFromCentroidInMeters","2000"),
pred("country","SE"),
format = "SIMPLE_CSV")
```

GBIF currently uses only **PCLI** level centroids from the [catalogue of centroids](https://github.com/jhnwllr/catalogue-of-centroids).

## Data Quality

GBIF is a large data aggregator. It mediates occurrences records from a large variety of sources:

-   Museums
-   eDNA
-   Citizen Science Apps
-   Ecological Surveys
-   Camera Traps
-   Satellite Tracking
-   Herbaria
-   Paleontology
-   Research Projects

For this reason, not all of the occurrences from GBIF are "fit for use", meaning they are not suitable for a **particular** purpose or project. Some data-quality issues are so well understood that there are automated ways to detect and remove them from a dataset.

-   Country Centroids
-   Living Specimens
-   Fossils
-   Uncertain Records
-   Country Coordinate Mismatch
-   Zero-Zero Coordinate
-   Any-Zero Coordinates
-   Gridded Datasets

Since **rgbif** is not a data cleaning package, please see the following resources for post-processing your occurrence downloads:
