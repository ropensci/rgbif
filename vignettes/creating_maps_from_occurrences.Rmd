## Introduction 

Large datasets of millions of lat-lon points can be difficult to plot using `ggplot2` or base graphics. In these cases, using the [GBIF maps API](https://www.gbif.org/developer/maps) with `rgbif::map_fetch()` can be a good option. 

However, if you would like to make a complex graphic with different colors, shapes, and legends, using `ggplot2::geom_sf()` is a better option. Below I will give examples using both methods.  

## Using map_fetch()

> requires >= rgbif 3.7.8

`map_fetch()` will return the default GBIF pixel map of all occurrences map as a `magick::magick-image`. To save this `png` you can use `magick::write_image()`. 

```R
map_fetch()
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/dot_map.png")
```

It is also possible to make static maps that look like default [occurrence search](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?taxon_key=212) maps. See the maps api page for [available styles](https://tile.gbif.org/ui/). 

```R 
map_fetch(taxonKey=212,style="scaled.circles",base_sytle="gbif-light")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/gbif-light-scaled-circles-birds.png")
```

For "poly" styles it is also possible to plot set the `hexPerTile` parameter, so that the binned occurrence data is essentially shown at a higher resolution. A tile is an individual `png` image that is fetch from the API in order to make a map. The default settings of `map_fetch()` will fetch two images, so the image below has 400 hexagons across the width of map. 

```R 
map_fetch(hexPerTile=200,style="green.poly",base_style="gbif-dark",bin="hex")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/hexpertile.png")
```

There is also the option to plot with polar or artic projections. For example, penguin records. 

```R 
map_fetch(srs='EPSG:3031',taxonKey=7190978,style='glacier.point', base_style="gbif-dark")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/artic-peguins-glacier-point-gbif-dark.png")
```

It is also possible to get views other than just the global map, by zooming in and selecting only certain map tiles with `z`, `x`, `y`. 

Seleting tiles can be tricky to get right, but with a little trial-and-error, you can usually get close to the map you want to have. One trick for getting the right tiles, is to look at this [demo page](https://api.gbif.org/v2/map/demo13.html#map=3/0/0/0), where the `z,x,y` values are printed on the center of each tile. 

For example, you can see what the tile values for a zoomed in map of Australia would be [here](https://api.gbif.org/v2/map/demo13.html#map=5/134.01/-21.64/0).

```R 
map_fetch(z=3,x=13:14,y=4:5)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/AU-zoom.png")
```

Be aware that selecting many tiles will create a large image, and might crash your R session. You can control the resolution of your final image with `format`, with  `format="@4x.png"` being the highest possible value. 

Below are some areas to give you an idea of how `z`,`x`,`y` it are working. 

```R 
# Europe
map_fetch(z=3,x=7:9,y=0:2)
# Africa
map_fetch(z=3,x=7:10,y=2:5)
# Hawaii
map_fetch(z=6,x=6:9,y=23:25)
# South Africa 
map_fetch(z=5,x=34:38,y=19:22)
# Ukraine 
map_fetch(z=6,x=70:78,y=13:16)
# Iceland
map_fetch(z=6,x=55:59,y=8:9)
# Capri Is. 
map_fetch(z=12,x=4419:4420,y=1124:1125)
```

I suggest using this [interactive page](https://api.gbif.org/v2/map/demo13.html#map=3/0/0/0) for getting the tile numbers. 

Keep in mind that the the GBIF maps API wasn't designed to make high quality static maps, like it is being used for in `map_fetch()`. It was designed for interactive use on the [GBIF website](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?), so the API design reflects this reality. 

When making maps, the **named paramters**, `taxonKey`, `datasetKey`, `country`, `publishingOrg`,  `publishingCountry`, `year`, and `basisOfRecord` are going to be the easiest to use.  However, It is also possible to make "any" map (any [search filter](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?recorded_by=John%20Waller&advanced=1&occurrence_status=present)) using `source=adhoc`. 

```R 
# all occurrences with iucn status critically endangered 
map_fetch(z=1,x=0:3,y=0:1,source="adhoc",iucn_red_list_category="CR",
          style="iNaturalist.poly",base_style='osm-bright',bin="hex")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE,out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/adhoc-iucn.png")
```

`map_fetch()` can also tell when you have used a parameter that is no a default parameter and automatically switch to `source="adhoc"` for you. I have found that point style don't work well with `source="adhoc"`, so `map_fetch()` will give a warning if you try to use a point style with `source="adhoc"`. 

Here are some examples of maps with different parameters and styles. 

`adhoc` is needed here  because `recordedBy` isn't one of the named paramters. `map_fetch()` automatically detects this and switches source to "adhoc". 

```R 
map_fetch(recordedBy="John Waller")
```
Occurrences in the OBIS network. Note that `squareSize` only works with `bin="square"`.

```R
map_fetch(z=1,source="adhoc",style="green.poly",squareSize=64,bin="square",network_key="2b7c7b4f-4d4f-40d3-94de-c28b6fa054a6")
```

Map of Texas using the `gadm` filter.

```R 
map_fetch(z=4,x=6:7,y=4:5,gadm_gid="USA.44_1",style="blue.marker") 
```
`map_fetch()` is generally forgiving and will give you back at least some map with warnings or blank images when the parameters don't work.

```R 
map_fetch(x=1:5) # no tiles exist past 2, so blank images are returned
```

All specimen bird records from the year 2000.

```R 
map_fetch(taxonKey=212, basisOfRecord="PRESERVED_SPECIMEN", year=2000,style="classic-noborder.poly")  
```

Map of all country centroid locations.

```R 
map_fetch(distanceFromCentroidInMeters=0,base_style="osm-bright")
```

In general, adhoc maps are harder to make look nice, but usually picking a non-point style and tuning `hexPerTile` and perhaps also `squareSize`, will make a nice map.

```R 
map_fetch(source="adhoc",project_id="BID-AF2015-0134-REG",style="green2.poly",hexPerTile=50)
```

A tip for getting the un-named adhoc parameters is to pull them from the occurrence search URL after looking them up via the [web interface](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?advanced=1&project_id=BID-AF2015-0134-REG).

```R
# https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/map?advanced=1&project_id=BID-AF2015-0134-REG
map_fetch(source="adhoc",project_id="BID-AF2015-0134-REG") 
```

## Using geom_sf()

The GBIF maps API is powerful and useful, but can be frustrating if your plot needs a some custom styling or legends. If you don't have a **large** dataset, then using `ggplot::geom_sf()` can be a good option.  

```R 
library(ggplot2)
library(sf)
library(rnaturalearth)

# occ_download(pred_default(),pred(taxonKey,"1427067"),format="SIMPLE_CSV")

worldmap <- ne_countries(scale = 'medium', type = 'map_units',returnclass = 'sf')

# a download I made of all Calopteryx splendens occurrences 
d <- occ_download_get('0001707-230810091245214') %>%
  occ_download_import()

d_sf <- sf::st_as_sf(d, coords = c("decimalLongitude", "decimalLatitude"),
        crs = "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84")

# color occurrences by basisOfRecord
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = worldmap) + 
  geom_sf(data = d_sf,aes(color=basisOfRecord))
   
```

See [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) docs for more. 

## Using leaflet

Since the GBIF maps API was designed to work as an interactive map, it can be used with [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/). 

```R 
library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>% 
  addTiles() %>%
  addTiles(urlTemplate='https://api.gbif.org/v2/map/occurrence/density/{z}/{x}/{y}@1x.png?style=scaled.circles&taxonKey=5219404') 

```

See [leaflet](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggsf.html) docs for more.
