> GBIF has an experimental feature that allows users to download data from the GBIF database in SQL format. <https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/api-sql-downloads>

The experimental Occurrence SQL Download API allows users to query GBIF occurrences using SQL. In contrast to the [Predicate Download API](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/api-sql-downloads), the SQL API allows selection of the columns of interest and generation of summary views of GBIF data.

SQL downloads, like regular downloads, required you to set up your **GBIF credentials**. I suggest that you follow this [short tutorial](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/gbif_credentials.html) before continuing.

``` r
# test if your download is set up correctly 
# occ_download_sql_prep("SELECT datasetKey, countryCode, COUNT(*) FROM occurrence WHERE continent = 'EUROPE' GROUP BY datasetKey, countryCode")

occ_download_sql("SELECT datasetKey, countryCode, COUNT(*) FROM occurrence WHERE continent = 'EUROPE' GROUP BY datasetKey, countryCode")
```

`occ_download_get()`and `occ_download_import()` still work with SQL downloads.

``` r
occ_download_get("0000967-240425142415019") %>%
  occ_download_import()
```

## Supported SQL

Only `SELECT` queries are supported, and only queries against a single table named `occurrence`. `JOIN` queries and sub-queries are not allowed. Selecting `*` is also not allowed. One must explicitly select the columns needed.

`GROUP BY` queries are supported, as are basic SQL window functions (`OVER` and `PARTITION BY`). `ORDER BY` is supported. 

Most common SQL operators and functions are supported, such as `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IS NULL`, `RAND()`, `ROUND(…)`, `LOWER(…)`, etc. Case is ignored by the GBIF SQL parser, and all column names are returned as lowercase.

You can use `occ_download_prep()` to check if your query is valid.

``` r
occ_download_prep("SELECT * FROM occurrence WHERE year = 2000") 
# Should return an ERROR since "*" is not allowed
```

If you need **all** occurrence columns, most of the time you can use the regular [download interface](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/getting_occurrence_data.html) `occ_download(pred("year", "2000"))` instead of the SQL interface.

Note that if you doing `GROUP BY` `COUNT(*)` type queries for a single dimension, then `occ_count(facet="x")` is usually going to be a much faster option. See article [Getting Occurrence Counts From GBIF](https://docs.ropensci.org/rgbif/articles/occ_counts.html). 

To get a list of all +400 columns and definitions in the **occurrence** table, you can use `occ_download_describe("sql")$fields`.

## SQL examples - Species Counts 

One common query that is difficult to do with the regular download interface is to get a count of species by some other dimension. Keep in mind that if you only need species counts for one dimension, then `occ_count(facet="x")` is usually going to be a much faster option.

**Countries with the most species published to GBIF.** 

```r
sql <-
"
SELECT publishingcountry, specieskey, COUNT(*) as occurrence_count
FROM occurrence
WHERE publishingcountry IS NOT NULL AND specieskey IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY country, specieskey
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
"

```



## SQL examples - Grid Functions

Making a global map of unique species counts per grid cell is a common task, but because it requires a spatial join with the chosen spatial grid, it can be difficult to do without working with un-aggregated and therefore BIG data. 

For this reason GBIF's SQL downloads provide support for a few pre-defined [grid functions](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/data-use/api-sql-download-functions).

    COALESCE(coordinateUncertaintyInMeters, 0)
  ) AS mgrs,
  COUNT(DISTINCT speciesKey) AS unique_species_count

"

# occ_download_sql(sql) 

d <- occ_download_get('0007780-240425142415019') %>%
  occ_download_import() %>%
  filter(!mgrs == "") %>%
  mutate()

mgrs_grid <- st_read("C:/Users/ftw712/Desktop/MGRS_100kmSQ_ID_32M/")



library(sf)
library(dplyr)

# st_read("C:/Users/ftw712/Desktop/MGRS_100kmSQ_ID_32M/") 

# st_read("C:/Users/ftw712/Desktop/MGRS_100kmSQ_ID_32M/") %>%
